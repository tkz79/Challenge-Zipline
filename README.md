# TASK DESCRIPTION

The goal of this exercise is to identify rows in a CSV file that may represent the same person based on a provided Matching Type (definition below).

The resulting program should allow us to test at least three matching types:

one that matches records with the same email address
one that matches records with the same phone number
one that matches records with the same email address OR the same phone number

## Guidelines

Please DO NOT fork this repository with your solution
Use any language you want, as long as it can be compiled on OSX
Only use code that you have license to use
Don't hesitate to ask us any questions to clarify the project

## Resources

### CSV Files
Three sample input files are included. All files should be successfully processed by the resulting code.

### Matching Type
A matching type is a declaration of what logic should be used to compare the rows.
For example: A matching type named same_email might make use of an algorithm that matches rows based on email columns.

## Interface
At a high level, the program should take two parameters. The input file and the matching type.

## Output
The expected output is a copy of the original CSV file with the unique identifier of the person each row represents prepended to the row.
